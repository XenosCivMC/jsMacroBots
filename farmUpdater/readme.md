# Farm Updater

This Script wraps the new Agribot from IntentGames for testing purposes. This way you can update the starting and finishing messages for the bot manually in a fancy menu.

Add farmsUpdaterService.js to your JSMacros Services. This will enable a GUI, that you can display via a keybinding.
For the keybinding add the farmsUpdaterKeybinding.js to the JSMacros Keybindings.

there is a farms.json file in this directory which contains all farm names. Feel free to edit this for your own purposes!

If you have any questions, comments or anything else, please contact Xenos in the Discord or open an issue here!

Known bug: there might be some issues with screen size and gui-scale. I play on FullHD and a 2x gui-scale. If the
gui scale is set to higher values, the menu might not work/gets displayed differently.
